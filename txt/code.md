## What do you code in?

Lately, mostly C. I'm proficient in C++, C#, Python, Bash, JavaScript and HTML/CSS, too.

## Got anything to show for it?

Yup! Some of my notable projects include:

- [truedark-vim](https://github.com/bratpeki/truedark-vim), a truly dark color scheme for Vim/Neovim
	- [truedark-vifm](https://github.com/bratpeki/truedark-vifm), same colors, but for Vifm
- [Bash scripts](https://github.com/bratpeki/bash-scripts) that go nicely with window managers
- [My fork of Suckless' dmenu, dwm and st](https://github.com/bratpeki/suckless)
- [Some simple startpages](https://github.com/bratpeki/startpages)

There's also a few basic projects in C that might interest you, such as:

- [grap.h](https://github.com/bratpeki/grap.h), a text-based graphing library
- [SDL2 boilerplate](https://github.com/bratpeki/c-sdl2-boilerplate) for a GUI appliaction

Other **non-code** projects are:

- [tools](https://github.com/bratpeki/tools), a list of (mostly) open-source tools, such as trackers, DAWs, plugins, editors, etc.
- [A modern MilkyTracker guide](https://github.com/bratpeki/modern-milkytracker-guide), which aims to completely document MilkyTracker
- [soundfonts](https://github.com/bratpeki/soundfonts), a collection of SF2 files for music production
- [Build instructions](https://github.com/bratpeki/build_instruct) for some open-source programs I fancy
