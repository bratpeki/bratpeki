## What do you code in?

Lately, mostly C. I'm proficient in C++, C#, Python, Bash, JavaScript and HTML/CSS, too.

## Got anything to show for it?

Yup! Some of my notable projects include:

- [truedark-vim](https://github.com/bratpeki/truedark-vim), a truly dark color scheme for Vim/Neovim
- [Bash scripts](https://github.com/bratpeki/bash-scripts) that go nicely with window managers
- [My fork of Suckless' dmenu, dwm and st](https://github.com/bratpeki/suckless)
