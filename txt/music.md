## I wanna hear something!

Sure! Be warned, I go by the name of `xrtd` whenever I make music, to keep things separate and clean. :)

I have a couple albums on [Bandcamp](https://xrtd.bandcamp.com/).<br>
You can find my tracker modules on [The Mod Archive](https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_profile&query=95079).<br>
I also have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@realxrtd), where you can listen to some DJ sets.

## Any recommendations?

- ["8 bit sea shanty" (Just some classic chiptune)](https://modarchive.org/module.php?199503)<sup>1</sup>
- ["Pseudoutilitarianism" (Violins and choirs along a drum pattern)](https://xrtd.bandcamp.com/track/pseudoutilitarianism)
- ["Reiteration" (Vocal chops, overlayed with some calm chords)](https://xrtd.bandcamp.com/track/reiteration)
- ["jazzy!" (Self explanatory, LOL)](https://xrtd.bandcamp.com/track/jazzy)
- ["osc!" (Some basic oscillators and a fast drum pattern)](https://xrtd.bandcamp.com/track/osc)

## How do you licence?

[CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

## What do you use?

A lot of software. Most of it is listed under my [tools repo](https://github.com/bratpeki/tools).<br>
Mainly, however, I use **Ardour** and **MilkyTracker**.<br>
LMMS, ft2-clone and SchismTracker are also there on occasion.

## Any plugins?

A few.
I'm a firm believer in the fact that one EQ that you *know* how to use beats 10 where you know all of them partially.

I *(mainly)* use:

- ACE plugins that come with Ardour
- AutoTalent and TalentedHack
- Calf Studio Gear
- ZynAddSubFx
- x42-plugins
