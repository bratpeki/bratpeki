Hello!<br>
I'm Petar, known by most as Peki.

I'm a tracker musician, Linux h4x0r, open source enthusiast,
sucker for good sound design, DJ and in-good-part tech traditionalist
that makes *semi-art* using computers.

I've been making electronic music since 2016 and have moved quite a bit,
from FL's demo version to Abelton Live Lite all the way to the FOSS tools
I use today.
I've also been coding since 2018, and have taken many of my projects to
competitions where they've won a bunch of awards, plaques and *shiny* medals!

I do photo editing using GIMP, videos using Kdenlive, games and
interactive experiences using Godot as well as a whole slew of other
hobbies I try to tend to!
