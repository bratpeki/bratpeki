## Hello! I'm Petar, known by most as Peki.

I'm a

- Semi-artist
- DJ
- Tracker musician
- Linux h4x0r
- Chess aficionado
- Big fan of internet horror and the Slenderverse
- Open source enthusiast
- Sucker for good sound design
- In-good-part tech traditionalist

I've been making electronic music since 2016 and have moved quite a bit,
from FL's demo version to Abelton Live Lite all the way to the FOSS tools
I use today.

I've also been coding since 2018, and have taken many of my projects to
competitions where they've won a bunch of awards, plaques and *shiny* medals!

I do photo editing using GIMP, videos using Kdenlive, games and
interactive experiences using Godot as well as a whole slew of other
hobbies I try to tend to!
