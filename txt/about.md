Hello!<br>
I'm Petar, known by most as Peki.

I'm a semi-artist, tracker musician, Linux h4x0r, open source enthusiast and
in-good-part tech traditionalist that makes *"art"* using computers. :)

I've been making electronic music since 2016 and have moved quite a bit,
from FL's demo version to Abelton Live Lite all the way to the FOSS tools
I use today.

I also do photo editing using GIMP, videos using Kdenlive, games and
interactive experiences using Godot as well as a whole slew of other
hobbies I try to tend to!
